# python-challenge

The week 3 challenge here was done with referencing the various slides and session files for the most part. However, there were outside sources used.
https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/list/index: this was used to find out how to index because I could not find the notes or activities which used it
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8362792/how-do-i-shift-the-decimal-place-in-python: this was used for shifting the decimal, to round to the nearest hundredth in the first part and the thousandth for the second
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-generate-successive-element-difference-list/: this was used for getting a list of changes across the second column and setting it to the change variable in the first part of the challenge
